    - Player name input authentication (have a character limit, and display this in the printing function, using regex to create an alignment buffer)
    - move input authentication  
    - Refactor code
    - Add player name references (instead of to just 'player 1' and 'player 2')
    - rename "play_string", as the 'string' part of the name is potentially misleading
    - Add PyQT gui
    - TypeScript version
    - C# version
